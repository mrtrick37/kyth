# - 50% pressure / 15 s (old defaults) fires during every game loading screen
#   because shader compilation and asset streaming routinely sustain high

#   look like "memory crashes" but aren't OOM — just oomd misfiring.
# - 65% pressure / 40 s gives games room to burst through loading spikes while
#   still catching genuine runaway processes well before the kernel OOM killer.
# - SwapUsedLimit raised to 85%: zram compresses at ~3:1, so 85% of 14 GB of
